# Vectors

## Vectors from Physics POV

Scalars and Vectors

Magnitude with Direction

## Vectors from Maths POV

Always from origin and the coordinate system

Row Vector and Column Vector

### Co-ordinate Systems

Unit Vectors

## Vectors from CS POV

List of numbers

Magnitude of a Vector

## Vector Operations

### Magnitude of Vector

### Addition

### Distance between Vectors

### Angle between Vectors

The intiution one can draw is:

- If the angle between the vectors are small then they are similar
- If the angle between the vectors are large then they are different

### Concept of Scaling (Scalars)

### Dot Product

### Cross Product

### Projection of a Vector

### Basis Vectors

### Span of Vectors

### Linearly Dependent VS Linearly Independent

## Linear Transformations

# Matrices

## Types of Matrices
