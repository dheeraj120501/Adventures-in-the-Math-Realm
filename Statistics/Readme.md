# Probability Theory

Probability Measure

Sample Space

## Population VS Sample

Population is the collection of all the items of intrest to our study.

- It's usually denoted by N and the numbers are called parameters.
- Populations are hard to define and observe (i.e. are costly and time consuming) in real life.

Sample is the subset of Population.

- It's usually denoted by n and the numbers are called statistics.
- Samples are easier to contact, less time consuming and less costly.

## Outliers

## Covariance and Correlation

# Different Kinds of Plots/Graphs

Scatter plot, Pair Plot, Histogram or Density Plot, Box Plot, Violin Plot
